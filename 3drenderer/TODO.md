## TO DO

### Window
- create getters and setters for window attributes (such as, dimensions, position, vsync, fullscreen mode, fps limiter, etc.)
- add functionality for re-creating the window (this entails re-generation of OpenGL-assets that can't be transfered between contexts, like VAOs)
- create a controller that takes in input events generated by GLFW's pollEvents(), and translates those into actions in the Scene

### Renderer
- create Scene-class that holds the current state of the renderable world
- separate Renderer into different render passes, for example, color pass for scene rendering, shadow pass for shadows etc.
- Renderer should not initialize the Scene, rather, this should be done inside Scene
- textures should be bound to Models, which should consist of Textures, Meshes, and possibly later, armatures

### ShaderProgram
- uniforms should be stored in a Map or some other container where they can be easily fetched from
- extract shaders into their own Shader-class
- create classes for different types of uniforms, however, this should be done later when uniform objects come into play

### Camera
- finish Camera-class so that it can be rotated and moved around the scene

### VAO
- extract mesh info into a separate Mesh-class
- mesh info should not be represented by arrays, possibly
- VAOs should be generated based on Meshes
- consider creating a VBO-class for VBO generation
